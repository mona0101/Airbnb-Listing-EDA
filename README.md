# Airbnb Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) ‚úàÔ∏èüè°

This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on an Airbnb dataset using **Python** in **Jupyter Notebook**. The goal is to uncover insights about property listings, pricing, availability, and optimal strategies for revenue growth and booking optimization.

## üîç Project Overview

The analysis reveals interesting patterns and relationships between various listing features, pricing, and availability that can help optimize Airbnb host strategies. Below are some key insights:

- **Calculated Host Listings Count and Availability**: 
  - A moderate positive correlation exists between the number of listings a host manages (calculated host listings count) and the availability of those listings throughout the year. Experienced hosts with more listings tend to have higher availability.

- **Price and Availability**:
  - There is a slight negative correlation between price and availability. Listings with higher prices tend to have lower availability, likely due to strategic pricing or high demand for unique features. Additionally, seasonal fluctuations in both price and availability are observed, where prices rise during peak seasons, leading to lower availability as bookings fill up faster.

- **Availability and Minimum Nights**: 
  - Listings with longer minimum stay requirements tend to show higher availability throughout the year. Balancing booking policies with guest preferences and occupancy rates could optimize availability.

## üí° Potential Pricing Adjustments

- **Listings in the $200 Range**: 
  - Consider evaluating if listings priced in the $200 range are attracting enough bookings. Adjustments in pricing or feature enhancements could improve booking rates.

- **Competitive Pricing in the $100 Range**: 
  - Comparing the pricing distribution with competitors can help determine if the $100 price point is competitive. Adjustments might be necessary to stand out among similar listings.

## üîë Revenue Optimization Strategies

- **Dynamic Pricing Strategies**:
  - Implement data-driven dynamic pricing based on factors such as seasonality, local events, and competitor pricing to optimize revenue without deterring potential guests.

- **Highlight Value Propositions**:
  - Emphasize unique selling points such as local experiences, amenities, or a sense of community to justify pricing for all room types. This can increase perceived value and attract more bookings.
