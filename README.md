# Airbnb Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) ✈️🏡

This project focuses on performing an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on an Airbnb dataset using **Python** in **Jupyter Notebook**. The goal is to uncover meaningful insights, identify patterns, and explore trends to better understand factors influencing property listings, pricing, and guest preferences.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Airbnb provides a global platform for booking short-term stays. By analyzing its dataset, we aim to answer important questions such as:
- **What factors impact property pricing?**
- **How does location influence booking trends?**
- **Which property types are most popular?**

This EDA explores these questions through data cleaning, visualization, and feature analysis.

## 💡 Key Features

- **Data Cleaning**: 
  - Handle missing values, outliers, and incorrect data types.
- **Summary Statistics**: 
  - Gain an overview of key metrics like average price, review scores, and property types.
- **Visualizations**: 
  - Create interactive and static visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
- **Feature Analysis**: 
  - Explore relationships between features such as price, location, and reviews.
