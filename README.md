# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project ðŸ“Š

This project involves performing an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using **Python** and **Jupyter Notebook** to uncover insights from a dataset. The analysis helps in understanding the underlying patterns, correlations, and relationships between different features in the data.

## Project Overview

The EDA process focuses on:

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring proper data types.
- **Summary Statistics**: Descriptive statistics to provide a high-level overview of the data.
- **Visualizations**: Using plots to explore feature distributions, correlations, and trends.
- **Feature Analysis**: Investigating relationships between key variables.

## Key Insights

Some general findings from the analysis may include:

- **Correlation between Features**: Identifying how different features relate to one another, such as positive/negative correlations.
- **Distribution of Variables**: Understanding how the data is distributed (e.g., price, age, ratings) to identify potential anomalies or trends.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifying outliers that may impact analysis and decision-making.
  
## Installation

To run this project, you need Python and the following libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
